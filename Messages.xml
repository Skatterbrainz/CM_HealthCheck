Of these, %3 were written to the site database, %4 were replicated to the parent site, %5 were reported as Windows Events on the site server, and %6 were passed as command-line parameters to external programs. During this time, Status Manager received %7 corrupt files that contained one or more status messages that could not be processed. Also during this time, Status Manager used %8 hours of CPU time, which represents a %9 percent utilization of the total CPU time available for the period.

Every time Status Manager receives a status message it will update the performance counters contained by this performance object. You can measure Status Manager's processing performance by monitoring this performance object with the Windows Performance Monitor. For example, you can monitor the total number of status messages written to the site database by Status Manager by monitoring the "_Total" instance of the "Written To SMS Database" counter. Status Manager resets all of the counts when it is restarted, and the counts cannot be viewed when Status Manager is not running.%12</Description>

    <Description>Status Manager successfully initialized an in-memory queue to forward status messages to the summarizer component %1. The summarizer distills the stream of status messages into a high-level summary, which you can view under the System Status node of the Configuration Manager Console. You can monitor the performance of the in-memory queue in the Windows Performance Monitor by selecting the "SMS In-Memory Queues" performance object, and then selecting the instance for this summarizer. For example, the "Total Objects Enqueued" counter tells you how many status messages Status Manager has forwarded to the summarizer. The counts are reset when both Status Manager and the summarizer are restarted, which typically occurs when SMS Executive is restarted. The counts cannot be viewed when Status Manager and the summarizer are both not running.%12</Description>

Configuration Manager Server Components and SMS Provider clients (such as the Configuration Manager Console) submit delta site control files to change the configuration of the site. A delta site control file contains one or more required changes to the actual site control file ("%2" at this site). The actual site control file contains the site configuration currently in use.

The site configuration change request was assigned the serial number %7 at site "%5". Site Control Manager uses this serial number to ensure that it does not process the same site configuration change request from an SMS Provider client (such as the Configuration Manager Console) more than once. When an SMS Provider client submits a delta site control file containing a site configuration change request, Hierarchy Manager at the site submitting the file will report status message 3307. You can track the time on message 3307 and this one to determine when the site configuration change request was submitted and when it actually went into effect.</Description>

    <Description>Site Control Manager will ignore this site configuration change request ("%1" from site "%2").%12

This change request was already processed as part of an older delta site control file. Hierarchy Manager at site "%2" will continue to submit this site configuration change request until it receives a copy of the new actual site control file from site "%3" that confirms the change was successfully processed. If you find that Hierarchy Manager continues to submit this site configuration change request for an extraordinarily long time, there might be a problem with Hierarchy Manager at any of the sites between and including sites "%2" and "%3". Or, if "%2" and "%3" are different sites, there might be a communication problem between them or any sites between them. If you suspect this is happening, check for Warning and Error status messages from Hierarchy Manager, Replication Manager, Scheduler, and the Sender components at these sites.</Description>

    <Description>Site Control Manager will maintain copies of the %1 most recent actual site control files in the directory "%2".%12

The actual site control file %3 contains the configuration currently in use at this site. You can compare the files in the "%2" directory with each other to determine how the site configuration has changed over time. Each file is named ????????.ct0, where ???????? is the actual site control file serial number in hexadecimal format. For example, actual site control file 20 would be named 00000014.ct0. Also, if the current actual site control file %3 ever becomes corrupted or is ever accidentally deleted, you can restore it from one of the versions in the "%2" directory. Contact Microsoft for help before attempting to restore "%3" from one of these versions.</Description>

Component Status Summarizer will automatically reset a component's status to OK every time the Component Status Threshold Period elapses and a new Threshold Period begins. For example, if the Threshold Period is "Since 12:00:00 AM", Component Status Summarizer will reset the component's status to OK every 24 hours at midnight. At this time, the counts of status messages reported by the component for the Threshold Period will be reset to zero.</Description>

    <Description>The program for deployment "%1" ("%4" - "%5") returned an exit code of "%2"("%12"), which indicates the operation was successful but a restart of the system is required for the operation to be complete. A restart might be pending because there is no maintenance window open. The restart will occur at the next available maintenance window. A status message indicating final success will be sent after the system has been restarted.

Configuration Manager determines status for each program it executes. Any program dependencies will not be executed until after the restart occurs. If Configuration Manager cannot find or correlate any installation status Management Information Format (MIF) files for the program, it uses the program's exit code to determine status.</Description>

    <Description>Possible cause: an SMS Discovery Data Manager bug.
Solution: If you suspect a software defect, refer to your SMS documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further troubleshooting information.

Possible cause: Something other than SMS created the DDR, and no value was specified as the Name.
Solution: Every discovery item needs to have some value that can be identified as the name of the resource. In System DDRs, for example, one of the following values is used as the Name: NetBIOS Name, Resource Names, IP Addresses, IPX Addresses, or MAC Addresses. If none of these are available, or if you have created a DDR of a new architecture, then pick a property and flag it as the Name by ORing decimal 64 in the property's Flags column.</Description>

    <MessageID>2703</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The file attempted to update inventory information in the SMS site database that does not already exist, or the file contains invalid syntax.

  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>2720</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: SMS Inventory Data Loader detected a MIF file (from the resource with GUID %1) that contains an update request for data that is not in the SMS site database. Therefore, SMS Inventory Data Loader wants to request a resynchronization, or full MIF file, from that resource.
Solution: On the resource with GUID %1, set the registry key HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_INVENTORY_DATA_LOADER\Resynchronize Clients to 1 (true).</Description>

    <MessageID>2802</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: Some site configuration change requests contained in the file might not have been applied to the actual site control file; consequently, the site might not be fully reconfigured.
Solution: SMS Site Control Manager will try to process the file again the next time a new delta site control file arrives at "%2" or the next time SMS Site Control Manager is restarted, whichever comes first. You can force SMS Site Control Manager to try to process the file again by stopping and restarting SMS Site Control Manager using the SMS Service Manager application.</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>2803</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The file could be unnecessarily processed again, or it might temporarily seem that the site has not been fully reconfigured.
Solution: Both of these problems will be resolved the next time a new delta site control file arrives at "%2" for processing, or the next time SMS Site Control Manager is restarted, whichever comes first. You can force this to occur immediately by stopping and restarting SMS Site Control Manager using the SMS Service Manager application.</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>2804</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The delta site control file contained a corrupt or invalid site configuration change request. Any successfully processed site configuration change requests in this file will remain in effect (i.e., those changes will not be "undone" from the actual site control file). However, the corrupt site configuration change request and all subsequent site configuration change requests in this file, were not made to the site configuration.
Solution: If the file was submitted by an SMS server component, the component will detect that the change was not made and will submit a new delta site control file, usually within a few minutes. If the file was submitted by the SMS Provider on behalf of one of its clients (such as the SMS Administrator console), SMS Hierarchy Manager will eventually detect that the change was not made and submit a new delta site control file. If the file was submitted by the SMS Provider at the current site, SMS Hierarchy Manager should submit a new file within 24 hours. If the file was submitted by the SMS Provider at a parent site, it could take longer than 24 hours. You can cause a new file to be submitted immediately by stopping and restarting SMS Hierarchy Manager at the site that submitted the file using the SMS Service Manager application. SMS Hierarchy Manager will continue to submit new delta site control files until all outstanding site configuration change requests have been made.</Description>

    <Description>Possible cause: The Software Inventory Agent requires at least 3 MB of virtual memory and 500 KB of disk space to begin the inventory cycle.
Solution: Add additional memory or disk space to the client.</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>10602</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: Software Inventory Agent needs to make a copy of each collected file before the files can be collected. There is insufficient disk space to allow this second copy to be made. As a result, some files that match the file collection criteria might not be collected on this inventory cycle. Either this client has insufficient disk space, or the file collection criteria specifies the collection of too many files.
Solution: Increase disk space on the client, or specify that fewer files be collected.</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>10603</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: Software Inventory Agent is limited in the total collected file size. This limit has been reached. As a result, some files that match the file collection criteria might not be collected on this inventory cycle.
Solution: Use the "Reconfigure the maximum data collected per client (MB)" option on the File Collection tab of the Software Inventory Client Agent Properties dialog box in the SMS Administrator console.</Description>

  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>10035</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The content for this program must be downloaded into the computer's cache, or the content could not be located.
Solution: If the program is being downloaded, no action is required. The program will start once the download has been successfully completed. If the content can not be located, ensure that a distribution point with this content is available for this computer.  Distribution point availability can be affected by roaming boundary configuration which is used to determine whether distribution points are classified as local or remote, or by enabling distribution points as protected distribution points. Distribution point availability can also be affected if you are using branch distribution points and the advertisement is configured with the option Run program from distribution point instead of Download content from distribution point and run locally. This is because branch distribution points do not support advertisements that are configured to run directly from a distribution point.</Description>

    <Description>Possible cause: The content source might not be available on any distribution servers, or the advertisement may have been marked not to run program when no local Distribution Point is available and this SMS client is in remote roaming boundaries of the site. Content source might not be available because the advertisement is configured with the option Run program from distribution point on one or more branch distribution points and is not available on a standard distribution point. Branch distribution points do not support advertisements that are configured with the option Run program from distribution point.
Solution: Use the Manage Distribution Points wizard to distribute the content to a distribution point. If this SMS client is expected to stay in remote roaming binderies then change the advertisement to allow running program from remote Distribution Point. Use the Manage Distribution Points wizard to distribute the content to a standard distribution point if you want to use the option Run program from distribution point.</Description>

  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>1211</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The Status Filter Rule specifies a program that is invalid or does not exist.
Solution: Correct the value of the Program box on the Actions tab of the Status Filter Rule Properties page in the SMS Administrator console. (Note that you are not limited to %3 characters in the Program box.) Be sure to explicitly specify the path to the program.  For example, specify "c:\winnt\system32\net.exe" instead of just "net.exe"..</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>1212</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The Status Filter Rule specifies a program that runs interactively and the program will not exit until it receives user input. This would happen, for example, if you specified "notepad.exe" as the program.
Solution: First correct the Status Filter Rule to specify a program that runs to completion without requiring user input; this is done by editing the Program box on the Actions tab of the Status Filter Rule Properties page in the SMS Administrator console. (Note that you are not limited to %3 characters in the Program box.) Then verify that the old program is not still running on the site server using the Windows NT Task Manager. If the old program is still running, use End Process in Task Manager to stop it.

Possible cause: The Status Filter Rule specifies a program that takes a long time to run.
Solution: Ignore this message, but consider changing the Status Filter Rule to specify a program that runs quickly. Slow programs, when executed frequently, will slow down the rate at which SMS Status Manager can process status messages, and might cause a large number of running processes to build up on your site server. If too many processes build up, the general performance of the site server might be affected..</Description>

    <Description>Possible cause: The system clock on computer "%2" is not synchronized with the site server's system clock. Most likely, the system clock on computer "%2" is set to some date greater than 2035 or less than 1970.
Solution: Synchronize the system clock of computer "%2" with the site server's system clock. Please refer to your Windows NT Server documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further information.

      When SMS Status Manager receives status messages with invalid time stamps, it will stamp these messages with the current system time on the site server. The messages will then be processed successfully, but their time and date might not be truly representative of when they were reported in real time. SMS Status Manager will continue to report this problem every 24 hours until you fix it.</Description>
  </MessageSolution>
  <MessageSolution>
    <MessageID>1215</MessageID>
    <Description>Possible cause: The system clock on computer "%2" is %3 or more seconds ahead of the site server's system clock.
Solution: Synchronize the system clock of computer "%2" with the site server's system clock. Please refer to your Windows NT Server documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further information.

      SMS Status Manager will process status messages with improper time stamps when the site server's system clock surpasses the improper time stamps. For example, this status message will not be processed for %3 seconds. SMS Status Manager will continue to report this problem every 24 hours until you fix it. SMS Status Manager will not report this problem if the system clock of computer "%2" is less than %4 seconds ahead of the site server's system clock. This interval is configurable in the SMS site control file. Please refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further information.</Description>

Solution: Verify that the computer running SQL Server site system is turned on, connected to the network, and functioning properly.

Possible cause: PXE Service point does not have sufficient access rights to the SQL server site system.
Solution: Verify that management point computer account or the Management Point Database Connection Account is a member of SMS Management Point Role (msdbrole_MP) in the SQL Server database.

Possible cause: Network problems are preventing the pxe service point from properly accessing the SQL Server.
Solution: Investigate and correct any problems with your network.
